To run the query and extract the 26 columns used by ucjeps, do the following in this directory:

nohup time psql -A -U reporter -d "host=ucjeps.cspace.berkeley.edu dbname=nuxeo password=csR2p4rt2r" -f ucjepsV2.sql -o ucjepsV2.csv

Caveats:

- Most of the fields extracted are empty (i.e. no CSpace data is extracted from them).  
However, many of these are empty in the original extract as well.

- There are many different notes and remarks fields in the format. I'm not sure which,
of these to try to map to CSpace data.

- Fields which still need to be extracted (in progress): Dimensions

- Note that the ComponentNumber and ComponentName fields *could* be filled in using the
ObjectNumber and ObjectName fields -- in CSpace the distinction is formally expressed using
the Object hierarchy, and that distinction is not being capture in the output file. 
Perhaps it should?

- The mappings should be checked. For example, there are ucjeps columns for Provenance, SiteName, 
and SiteNumber, but CSpace's Field Collection Place was mapped only to the first of these. 
CSpace's Ethnographic File Code was mapped to Purpose. Etc.
